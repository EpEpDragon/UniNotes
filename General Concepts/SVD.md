# Singular value decomposition
Factorization of real or complex matrix. Generalizes the [[Eigendecomposition]] of a squarer normal matrix with a orthonomal eigenbasis to any **n x m** matrix.
$$M = U\Sigma V^*$$
- Where $M$ is a **m x n** matrix
- $U$ is a **m x m** complex [[Unitary Matrix]]
- $\Sigma$ is a **m x n** rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers
- $V$ is a **n x n** complex [[Unitary Matrix]]

If $M$ is real then $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal, in this case:
$$M = U\Sigma V^T$$
