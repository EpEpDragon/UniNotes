# Full rank 
A matrix is full row rank when each of the rows of the matrix are linearly independent and full column rank when each of the columns of the matrix are linearly independent. 

For a square matrix these two concepts are equivalent and we say the matrix is full rank if all rows and columns are linearly independent. A **square matrix** is full rank if and only if its **determinant is nonzero**.
