# Discrete time signal
- Time axis discrete 
- Magnitude axis continuous

Thus has **precise magnitude** values at **discrete time** points

## Types
- [[Unit Impulse]]
- [[Unit Step]]
- [[Unit Ramp]]
- [[Discrete Time Exponential]]

## Operations
These operations are **not** [[Commutative]]
- [[Time Shift]]
- [[Reflection About Time Origin]]

## Frequency domain
The [[DTFT]] can be used to convert to frequency domain
