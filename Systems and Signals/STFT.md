# Short time Fourier transform
Using [[Windowing]], take the [[DFT]] of [[Nonstationary signals]] over a short time period to discern frequency changes.

Note the following trade-off
- The [[Windowing]] time should be short enough such that the windowed signals are mostly [[Stationary signals]]
- But the [[Windowing]] time should also be long enough to achieve sufficient frequency resolution
