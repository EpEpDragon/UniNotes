# Systems and Signals
- Signal can be represented by a sum of [[Sinusoidal]] signals, this represention can be found by using the [[Fourier transform]].
- Any signal can be decomposed into [[Even function]] and [[Odd function]]

## Types of signals
When converting between signals, if adhering to the [[Nyquist Theorem]], no data loss will occur in [[Sampler]], errors will occur in [[Quantisation]]. Thus the number of [[Quantisation]] levels should be high to minimize errors.
- [[Analog signals]]
- [[Discrete time signals]]
	- **Analog** to **Discrete**: [[Sampler]]
- [[Digital signal]]
	- **Discrete time** to **Digital**: [[Quantisation]]
	- Complete **Analog** to **Digital**:

## [[Stationary signals]]
## [[Nonstationary signals]]
## [[FFT]]
