# Kantian ethics
Form of [[Deontology]].
Founded by Immanuel Kant, German philosopher (1724-1804)

Moral principles that do not depend on contingency. Must apply in all context

Humans:
- Have reason
- Are morally autonomous
- Have intrinsic worth (dignity)
- Thus possess equal worth and deserve equal respect

This leads to the: ![[Categorical Imperative]]
## Respect for persons
Those actions or rules are morally right that regard each person as worthy of respect as a moral agent
- [[Golden Rule]] approach:
	- Does not always work, subjective
- Self defeating test:
	- If other do it you can no longer.
	- If others do it you can still do it, but it defeats the purpose.
	- Does not ensure respect, just that **if** someone is respected, everyone is
- Rights approach:
	- Negative interpretation: Protect from infringement of moral agency
	- Positive interpretation: Entitle us to active support of our interests
	- Some rights more important than others.
		- **First tier:** Most basic; essential preconditions for action.
		- **Second tier:** Rights to maintain level of purpose fulfilment already achieved.
		- **Third tier:** Rights necessary to increase one's level of purpose fulfilment.
