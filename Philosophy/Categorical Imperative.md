# Categorical Imperative
A universal law such that all **rational** being would accept it regardless of whether they are doers or receivers of actions commanded by the rule.

Two formulations:
- **Act only** according to that **maxim** by which you can at the same time will it should become a **universal law**
- **Act so** that you **treat humanity**, whether in your own person or in that of another, **always as an end** and never as a means only

Resembles the [[Golden Rule]], **not the same**. The [[Categorical Imperative]] is objective while the [[Golden Rule]] is subjective.
