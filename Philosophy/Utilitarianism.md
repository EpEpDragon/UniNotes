# Utilitarianism
Opposite to [[Deontology]]. Consequence based ethics.
Features:
- [[Consequentialism]]
- [[Hedonism]]
- [[Impartiality]]

## Classical act utilitarianism
An act is right only insofar it produces the greatest balance of **happiness** over **unhappiness** for **everyone** affected.

No distinction between acts and omissions

#### Strengths:
- Consistency
- Clear about goals of morality
- Clear about method for determining right and wrong
- Fundamental equality

#### Problems:
- Calculating consequences
- Happiness all that matters?
- Consequences all that matter?
	- Justice
	- Rights
	- Backward-looking consideration
- Too demanding

## Rule utilitarianism
Determine which **rule** generally brings about the best consequences and then follow that rule.

Does not take into account exceptional circumstances.

## Cost-benefit analysis
Consequences that matter are cost and benefits (financial terms)
- As approach to molarity can justify behaviour that seems morally unacceptable.
- Assumes everything can be measuresd in financial terms
