## [[Dimentionality reduction]]
Approximate higher dimention data by projecting to lower dimention 
- Can improve computation performance, if model scales poorly with dimentionality
- Can be more stable, leading to better preformance
- Redundant infromation removed, exposing key data structire more clearly
