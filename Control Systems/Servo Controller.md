## Design
- Design a [[State Regulator]]
- Design $\bar{N}$ using above relationships 

## Derivation
At steady state $x_{ss}$ and $u_{ss}$ are constant and $y_{ss}$ is proportional to $u_{ss}$
Thus command $y_{ss}$ to $r$ by commanding $x(t)$ to $x_{ss}$ and y(t) to $u_{ss}$ , using gains $N_{x}$ and $N_{u}$
