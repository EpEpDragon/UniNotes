# State space control
- Matrix of first order differential
- Canonical forms
	- [[Control Canonical Form]]
	- [[Observer Canonical Form]]
	- [[Jordan]]
- Eigen values are poles of system
- Estimator
- Controllability, observability
- Reference input
- Integral control

## Model
The rate of change of the state vector is dependant on both the current states x(t) and input signal u(t).

Note **d**, and **c** is the same as in the [[State Space Discrete]] model
