# Control canonical form
Easier to design feedback controllers by hand
## Continuous
Write someting here

## Discrete
For the general third order **TF**, as can be found from the [[State Space Continuous-Discrete relationship]]:

The contorl canonical form is:

## Transformation matrix
If not in [[Control Canonical Form]] a transformation matrix **P** can be used to transform it.
