# [[System]]s approach
- Acknowledges the behavior of andy one [[Element]] affects the behavior of others
- No single [[Element]] can perform effectively without help form others
- Retains attention on overall [[System]] and the goal
	- Allows focus on ither parts but only in regard to their contribution to the whole [[System]]
- Avoids actions that focus exclusively on parts of the [[System]], subotimal for whole [[System]], as can be seen from [[1939 internal memo on project engineer]]

The [[Systems Approach]] is a **methodology** for solving problems and managing systems that accounts for:
- The **Objectives** and performance constraints of the [[System]]
- The **Enviroment** and constraints of the [[System]]
- The **Resources** of the [[System]]
- The [[Element]]s of the [[System]], functions, [[Attribute]]s and performace measures
- The **Integrations** among the [[Element]]s
- The **managment** of the [[System]]
